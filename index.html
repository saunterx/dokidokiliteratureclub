            Doki Doki Literature Club! (sometimes shortened to DDLC) is a 2017 visual novel video game developed by Team Salvato for personal computers. The story follows a student who reluctantly joins his high school's literature club at the insistence of his friend Sayori, and is given the option to romantically pursue her, Yuri, or Natsuki. Club president Monika also features heavily in the game's plot. The game features a non-traditional plot structure with multiple endings and unlockable cutscenes with each of the main characters. Although it initially appears to be a light-hearted dating sim, it is actually a metafictional psychological horror game that extensively breaks the fourth wall.[1][2]

            The game was developed by Team Salvato, an American independent game studio, in an estimated two-year period by a team led by Dan Salvato, previously known for his modding work as part of Project M. According to Salvato, the inspiration for the game came from his mixed feelings toward anime and a fascination for surreal and unsettling experiences. The game was released as freeware for Linux, macOS, and Windows, initially distributed through itch.io, and later became available on Steam.

            Doki Doki Literature Club! received positive critical attention for its successful use of horror elements and unconventional nature within the visual novel genre. The game also inspired various internet memes and achieved a large online following. An expanded version of the game, titled Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, was released as a premium game in 2021 for PCs as well as the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S home consoles. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for its side stories and gameplay on consoles, but some criticism for its lack of changes.

        <p>
                Doki Doki Literature Club! is a visual novel. As such, its gameplay has a low level of interactivity and consists of scenes with static two-dimensional images of characters in a first person perspective, accompanied by occasional choices by which the player advances the putative plot. The descriptions and dialogue are depicted in the form of accompanying text without voice acting. The game's narration is provided by the game's protagonist (whom the player controls), a member of the titular literature club, to which he was invited by his childhood friend Sayori.[3][4][5] Choices the protagonist makes affect the development of his relationships with key female characters Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki, but ultimately have little effect on the outcome of the game.[6][7]

            The characters' interactions with the protagonist are primarily influenced by a minigame in which the player "composes" a poem by picking from several sets of words. Each girl in the literature club has different word preferences, and their will react positively when the player picks a word that they like â€“except for Monika, who is not represented.[3][4][5][6] That Monika is not able to be romanced in this way not only affects the plot of the game, it ultimately proves to be the game, i.e. the meta-game.[8] As such, it is one of the first examples of meta-fiction in the medium.[9]

            In accordance with the results of these minigames, the player will experience scenes with whichever character liked that particular poem the most.[5][6] (Whether one aims to please a certain character or not is irrelevant, in as much as a poem is always someone's favorite.) Each such story arc is divided into three acts and an epilogue, whereupon the game restarts each time with increasingly divergent realities.[10] At a certain point, the player must manipulate the game's files in order to advance the narrative, choosing either to delete or not delete select characters.[11]

            Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! features the entire main campaign of the original game, but includes a "virtual desktop" allowing access to character files without needing to manipulate computer files, as well as unlockable images, soundtrack, story-related content, and several new "side stories". The new content is unlocked by completing the main campaign, as well as the side stories. The new stories depict characterization of the relationships between the four club members, as well as the formation of the literature club, without any interaction from the player.
